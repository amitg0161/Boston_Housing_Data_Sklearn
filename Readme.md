Linear Regression on Boston Housing Dataset

This Housing dataset contains information about different houses in Boston. This data was originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been removed now.

There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features. The dataset itself is available https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing . However, because we are going to use scikit-learn, we can import it right away from the scikit-learn itself.
